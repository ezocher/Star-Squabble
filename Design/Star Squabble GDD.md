# Star Squabble - Game Design Document - Draft 6/21

## Description

*"Risk" in Space*

A multiplayer turn-based 4X strategy game with units and combat inspired by Risk and with a 3D star map and traversable interstellar wormholes inspired by Ascendancy's starlanes.

Controlling territory is the primary objective like Risk, but there is also the traditional 4X "fog of war" where each player can only see the area that they've explored.

## Project Objectives

Develop a streamlined and visually simple game to focus on the gameplay, strategy, AI, and game architecture.

## Backstory

In a faraway elliptical galaxy, a cluster of stars formed from a dense molecular cloud. Conditions were nearly perfect, and the cluster was eventually teeming with life. An incredible diversity of forms had evolved on more than two dozen planets, and in two cases, consciousness had been achieved.

Sadly, before the /Bezzi and the Hommm had managed to contact one another, they both discovered that the massive blue star (120 solar masses) at the center of the cluster was becoming unstable and the Hommm had deduced that it was about to go supernova.

When the explosion came â€¦ *TBD*

On fifteen of the worlds, the hardiest microscopic life managed to survive in the crust and deep oceans of the planets.

Life, as it is prone to do, started again on its long evolutionary journey.

We pick up our story 1.5 billion years later. Sentient species have emerged on ten of the worlds and they are beginning to explore and colonize their solar systems. You are the supreme leader of one of those species.

# Gameplay

## Core Elements

### Star Systems

Star Systems have one star and one or more planets.

### Planets

Planets are habitable or challenging (toxic/too hot/too cold/etc.). Planets can be uninhabited or colonized.

Colonies on habitable planets can begin production as soon as they are founded. Colonies on challenging worlds begin terraforming at founding and when terraforming is complete they begin production.

Production slowly increases as population grows. ?? Production can be increased more quickly by building production instead of ships.

Planets produce ships.

### Ships

Ships come in 4 sizes and are either in-system ships or interstellar ships. The sizes are patrol (1 ship unit), destroyer (2 units), cruiser (4), and dreadnought (8).

Ships can explore other star systems (interstellar ships only), colonize unclaimed planets, fight space battles versus other ships, or invade other species' planets (taking over their colonies).

In-system ships can be built in any size and cost 50% of an interstellar ship of the same size. In-system ships cannot travel among the stars but can colonize planets in the system, invade planets in the system, or act as defense for a system.

### TIWs - Traversable Interstellar Wormholes

Every star system has one or more TIWs that can be used for FTL travel between systems. (Lore: it is not known if these are natural phenomena or were built by a departed species using technology beyond anyone's current understanding).

Ships must have special shielding and a star drive to enter and traverse these wormholes.

There are two types of TIWs: regular and long/slow

### Sectors

Star systems connected by regular TIWs constitute a sector

## Core Mechanics

### Exploration

Visiting a star system with ... reveals *TBD*

### Planetary Colonization

A planet can be colonized by a single ship of any size. The personnel from the ship become colonists and the ship's material is used in the founding of the colony. Larger ships will start a colony with a greater population, which results in a higher production rate at founding than a smaller population would provide.

### Ship Combat

Ships entering a system where there are ships from other species can choose to flee or engage. Ships already in a system can also choose to flee or engage. (Fight or Flight)

Fleeing by newly arrived ships happens by reentering the TIW they just arrived in and is always successful.

Fleeing by ships already in a system happens by entering a different (closest) TIW than the one the ships have just arrived in. In the case of a system with only one TIW, fleeing is unsuccessful if the arriving fleet engages. ?? Both Flee, what happens??

If engagement happens, then combat is conducted until one side's ships are completely eliminated (see combat details below).

If multiple fleets arrive and engage in a system on the same turn then a randomly chosen fleet chooses their first opponent. This is repeated until there is one fleet remaining and all other ships have been eliminated.]

### Planetary Invasion

If a fleet of ships eliminates all enemy ships in a system, then they can choose to attempt invasion of one of the enemy-occupied planets in the system (see combat details below).

In an unsuccessful invasion, the invading ship(s) are lost.

In a successful invasion the smallest ship in the invading fleet provides the occupying force and occupation materiel.

### Combat Mechanism

*Modified/Expanded Risk D6-based system - TBD*

?? One die per ship point

?? How many die per defending planet ?? pop-dependent

?? Max number of die and then multiple rounds? -OR- giant (wide) rolls all at once

# Game Architecture

## Core Architecture Principles

* Separated and pluggable UI
* Event-driven architecture
* Pluggable AI - Open and pluggable AI per player to enable rapid experimentation
* UI+AI gameplay: players decide which decisions to delegate to AI and choose AI(s) and AI settings

## Event-based architecture
