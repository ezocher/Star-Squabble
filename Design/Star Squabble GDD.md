# Star Squabble - Game Design Document
## Description
A multiplayer turn-based 4X strategy game with units and combat inspired by Risk and with a star map and interstellar travel inspired by Ascendancy.

## Project Objectives
Develop a streamlined and visually simple game to focus on the gameplay, strategy, and game architecture.

## Backstory
In a faraway elliptical galaxy, a smallish cluster of stars had formed from a dense molecular cloud. Conditions were nearly perfect, and the cluster was teeming with life. An incredible diversity of forms had evolved on more than two dozen planets, and in two cases, sentience had been achieved.

Sadly, before the X and the Y had managed to contact one another, they both discovered that the massive blue star (120 solar masses) at the center of the cluster was becoming unstable and the Y had deduced that it was about to go supernova.

When the explosion came â€¦ *TBD*

On fifteen of the worlds, the hardiest microscopic life managed to survive in the crust and deep oceans of the planets.

Life, as it does, started again on its long evolutionary journey.

We pick up our story 1.5 billion years later. Sentient species have emerged on ten of the worlds and they are beginning to explore and colonize their solar systems. You are leader of one of those species.
